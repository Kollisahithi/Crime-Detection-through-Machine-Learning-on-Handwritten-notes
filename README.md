# Crime-Detection-through-Machine-Learning-on-Handwritten-notes
You have been hired by the FBI to develop predictive models for detection of crime, your task is to help the Bureau and police departments to solve criminal cases dealing with evidence provided by handwritten documents such as wills and ransom notes. You are assigned to a forensic project by the FBI. The project requires you to apply machine learning to solve the handwriting comparison task in forensics. We formulate this as a problem of linear regression where we map a set of input features x to a real-valued scalar target y(x,w). Your task is to find similarity between the handwritten samples of the known and the questioned writer by using linear regression.
