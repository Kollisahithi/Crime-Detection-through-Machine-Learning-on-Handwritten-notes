# Crime-Detection-through-Machine-Learning-on-Handwritten-notes

  The FBI needs to develop predictive models for detection of crime. My task is to help the Bureau and police departments to solve criminal cases dealing with evidence provided by handwritten documents such as wills and ransom notes. In this project I am assumed to be assigned to a forensic project by the FBI. The project requires me to apply machine learning to solve the handwriting comparison task in forensics. 

  We formulate this as a problem of linear regression where we map a set of input features x to a real-valued scalar target y(x,w). The task is to find similarity between the handwritten samples of the known and the questioned writer by using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.
